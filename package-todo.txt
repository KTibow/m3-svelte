eventually:
- switch to px instead of rem where it makes sense (hard problem! where does it make sense?)
- use logical properties instead of top/bottom/left/right
- more css optimization (see discord)
- bring icons out of html??
- make layer use cursor pointer
- switch font mixins to use pure `font` (smaller, clearer)

WHEN anchor positioning:
use it for date field, tab indicator, split button, etc etc etc
