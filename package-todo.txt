"deprecated" things:
- change `svelte` to `peerDependencies` and make it `^5.0.0`
- drop the `import` export conditions for the css

other general things:
- switch to px instead of rem where it makes sense
- use logical properties instead of top/bottom/left/right

WHEN anchor positioning:
use it for date field, tab indicator, split button, etc etc etc

WHEN mixins:
use it for nav cmlx

WHEN css functions:
use it for density sizing?
