general things:
- switch to px instead of rem where it makes sense (hard problem! where does it make sense?)
- use logical properties instead of top/bottom/left/right
- switch @ktibow/material-color-utilities-nightly to an optional peer dep and to a separate entry point
- gsans flex
- more css optimization (see discord)
- bring icons out of html??
- figure out some way to only enable dynamic density if you need it and otherwise inline it (maybe make the user *directly define* --m3-density()?)
- merge #220

WHEN anchor positioning:
use it for date field, tab indicator, split button, etc etc etc
