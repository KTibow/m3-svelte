general things:
- switch to px instead of rem where it makes sense (hard problem! where does it make sense?)
- use logical properties instead of top/bottom/left/right
- switch @ktibow/material-color-utilities-nightly to an optional peer dep and to a separate entry point
- maybe have a folder for entry points? etc/{styles, recommended styles, tailwind styles, unocss preset, colors}
- gsans flex
- more css optimization (see discord)
- bring icons out of html??
- merge #220
- move input controls into Button/into Chip instead of using `for`
- move `parseSize` to animation as cleanup
- rewrite Layer to take up less space and maybe be @attached
- refactor focus classes into mixins
- all deprecated items
  - NO background support at all
  - NO default colors for genCSS
  - ONLY user defined --m3-density

WHEN anchor positioning:
use it for date field, tab indicator, split button, etc etc etc
