general things:
- switch to px instead of rem where it makes sense (hard problem! where does it make sense?)
- use logical properties instead of top/bottom/left/right
- switch @ktibow/material-color-utilities-nightly to an optional peer dep and to a separate entry point
- maybe have a folder for entry points? etc/{styles, recommended styles, tailwind styles, unocss preset, colors}
- gsans flex
- more css optimization (see discord)
- switch from background to surface
- bring icons out of html??
- merge #220
- move input controls into Button/into Chip instead of using `for`
- all deprecated items
