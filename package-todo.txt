other general things:
switch to px instead of rem where it makes sense

WHEN anchor positioning:
use it for date field, tab indicator, split button, etc etc etc

WHEN mixins:
use it for nav cmlx

WHEN css functions:
use it for semitransparency, rename m3-scheme to m3-color, use direct colors instead of rgb numbers
